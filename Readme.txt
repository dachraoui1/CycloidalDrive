Cycloidal drives can start with zero backlash and high torque capacity while compact in size, unlike Involute gearboxes. They are useful in situations where low speed with high torque capacity is needed. Cycloidal drives may be designed with significantly higher contact areas for their size than any gear-based transmission such as epicyclic gears, applying force through many of the 'teeth' at once, allowing very high torque output for the size of the drive at the cost of utilising sliding contact.
